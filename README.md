# bincapz

![bincapz logo](./images/logo_small.jpg)

Experimental tool to enumerate capabilities and detect malicious behavior within binaries through fragment analysis.

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

## Features

- Analyzes binaries from any architecture - arm64, amd64, riscv, ppc64, sparc64
- Supports scripting languages such as bash, PHP, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS, and Python
- 12,000+ rules, for detecting everything from ioctl access to malware
- Integrates [YARA forge](https://yarahq.github.io/), with rules by Avast, Elastic, FireEye, Google, Mandiant, Nextron, and more.
- Diff-friendly JSON output to detect when capabilities change over time
- CI/CD friendly

## Shortcomings

- This tool is in early development with unstable output
- Does not attempt to process archive files (jar, zip, apk)
- Minimal rule support for Windows executables (help wanted!)

## Installation

```shell
go install github.com/chainguard-dev/bincapz@latest
```

## Usage

To inspect a binary, pass it as an argument to dump a list of predicted capabilities:

```shell
bincapz /bin/ping
```

```
/sbin/ping

```

If you want to focus on the most suspicious behaviors, you can pass `--min-level=3`, which will remove a lot of the noise by only showing "HIGH" or "CRITICAL" risk behaviors.

## Diff mode for detecting supply-chain compromises

Let's say you are a company that is sensitive to supply-chain compromises. You want to make sure an update doesn't introduce unexpected capability changes. There's a `--diff` mode for that:

```shell
bincapz -diff old_ffmpeg.dylib new_ffmpeg.dylib
```

Here is a result using the 3CX compromise as a test case.

Alternatively, you can also store the JSON output and diff the keys by hand:

```shell
bincapz --format=json <file> | jq  '.Files.[].Behaviors | keys'
```

## Supported Flags

* `--all` - Don't filter anything out, include even harmless capabilities

## FAQ

### How does it work?

bincapz automates the same steps that almost any security analyst performs when faced with an unknown binary: a cursory `strings` inspection. It does this using a library of 12,000+ YARA rules, including some that read byte streams and decrypt XOR/BASE64 data.

While this seems absurdly simple, it is exceptionally effective, as every binary leaves traces of its capabilities in its contents, particularly on UNIX platforms. These fragments are typically  `libc` or `syscall` references or error codes. Due to the C-like background of many scripting languages such as PHP or Perl, the same fragment detection rules often apply.

### Why not properly reverse-engineer binaries?

Mostly because fragment analysis is so effective. Capability analysis through reverse engineering is challenging to get right, particularly for programs that execute other programs, such as malware that executes `/bin/rm`. Capability analysis through reverse engineering that supports a wide array of file formats also requires significant engineering investment.

### Why not just observe binaries in a sandbox?

The most exciting malware only triggers when the right conditions are met. Nation-state actors in particular are fond of time bombs and locale detection. bincapz will enumerate the capabilities, regardless of conditions.

### Why not just analyze the source code?

Sometimes you don't have it! Sometimes your CI/CD infrastructure is the source of compromise. Source-code-based capability analysis is also complicated for polyglot programs, or programs that execute external binaries, such as `/bin/rm`.

### How does bincapz work for packed binaries?

bincapz alerns when an obfuscated or packed binary is detected. Depending on the packer used, fragment analysis may still work to a lesser degree. For the full story, we recommend unpacking binaries first.

### What related software is out there?

Much of bincapz's functionality is inspired by <https://github.com/mandiant/capa>. While capa is a fantastic tool, it only works on x86-64 binaries (ELF/PE), and does not work for macOS programs, arm64 binaries, or scripting languages. <https://karambit.ai/> and <https://www.reversinglabs.com/> offer capability analysis through reverse engineering as a service. If you require more than what bincapz can offer, such as Windows binary analysis, you should check them out.
